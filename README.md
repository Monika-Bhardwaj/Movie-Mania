📽️ Learn React with Vite — Movie App Project

    This React + Vite project is a simple movie search application that allows users to search for movies in real-time using an input field. As users type a movie name, the app fetches and displays matching results from an external API. It demonstrates core React concepts like component-based architecture, props, state management using hooks (useState, useEffect), and how to handle asynchronous data fetching. The app is responsive, cleanly structured, and optimized for fast development with Vite.


🚀 Features :

⚛️ Built with React (Functional Components & Hooks)
⚡ Powered by Vite for lightning-fast development
🎯 Minimal and clean component structure
🔍 Movie search functionality using real-time input
✅ ESLint for maintaining clean and consistent code
